Hello from AN from index.html in 
C:\aLab2016\lab2014Bo\it.unibo.iss2015intro\docs\Tools\Gradle\webOnBls\webAppl\src\main\webapp\jsp\index.html
 
<p>
 We can generate HTML response from servlets also but the process is cumbersome and error prone,
 when it comes to writing a complex HTML response, writing in a servlet will be a nightmare. 
 JSP helps in this situation and provide us flexibility to write normal HTML page and 
 include our java code only where it’s required.
</p>

  		<p>
		
			This is Led JSP (Java inside HTML, whereas servlet is "HTML inside Java") by AN that 
 			 allows us to mix static HTML with dynamically generated HTML - 
 			 in the way that the business logic and the presentation are well separated.
		</p>
		
  		<p>
  		When a JSP is first accessed, the server converts the JSP into a servlet; 
  		compile the servlet, and execute the servlet.
